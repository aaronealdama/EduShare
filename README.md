# EduShare

## What will the app do?

This app aims to solve the problem of people looking for alternative methods of education. Users will be able to view and upload content as well as follow people of interest depending on the different content they choose to upload.

## What technologies is EduShare going to implement?

EduShare is a full-stack application that is powered by React on the front-end and MongoDB on the backend. The ODM is Mongoose and there will also be different component libraries that will enhance user experience on the front end. This application will be deployed to Heroku.

## Who will be responsible for each part of the app?

I will be responsible for all aspects of designing and constructing this application front-end to back-end.

## What is the project MVP

The project MVP will be an application that allows users to upload videos and interact with multiple users using a follow/unfollow system. Videos will also be able to be searched and filtered using a search functionality that I will implement.

## Why would someone use EduShare

People looking to use EduShare will be those who want to supplement their education either by teaching others concepts they already know or learning about concepts from others. EduShare will be a free alternative for any student wishing to learn without any corporate influence or having to pay for access. EduShare is a platform that prides itself on education for all by everyone.
